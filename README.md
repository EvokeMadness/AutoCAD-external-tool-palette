# AutoCAD 2023 - My External Tool Palette

External tool palette for AutoCAD 2023. Lists commonly used commands from **Draw** and **Dimension** toolbars. This method of accessing AutoCAD tools and commands intends to limit the use of the ribbon and encourage the use of the **Command Line**. In addition to making an entry to the command line, the **Tool Palette** enables the user to list frequently used commands on a **Palette** and organize them into **Palette Groups**, tabs to the right of the tool palette. This method speeds up the workflow by making tools and commands accessible in more than one place, and displays the command's name explicitly to improve precision.
